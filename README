Here you will find informations about the Delphi packages and components that you need to successfully compile Marathon.
We start with the third party packages, which are not included in CVS. Please download and install them:
The current CVS state of Marathon uses IB Objects 4.3A. If you don't have this version or you never had IB Objects before, just drop me an E-Mail asking for it. Please also CC this E-Mail to Jason Wharton, the author of IB Objects, because else I can't send you the files, due to IB Objects is without cost but not free for Marathon contributors. This means that there is no cost obligation, but you are required to register your usage of IB Objects and agree to the terms of the Trustware License which IB Objects uses.
